1.
// We need to decide if a paragraph is in First, Second, or Third person
// We could check all the words of the paragraph and count I, We, You, He, She, They, etc.
// whichever count is the highest indicates the person

2. 
// declare three arrays with subjects for first, second, or third person
// declare three counts for first, second, or third person and start them at zero
// write a function that takes an argument 'paragraph'
// change the paragraph into an array of all the words

// use two for loops to check each word against the first person array of subjects
// increment the first person count for every paragraph word that matches a first person subject
// repeat the two previous steps for the second and third array/counts

// compare the count values to find which is the largest
// return a string that indicates if the paragraph is in first, second, or third person

/* The hardest part about problem-solving is considering the whole problem up front. I tend to want
to start trying things right away. It is better to begin by stating the goal and then beginning to come up 
with a strategy to try. This requires the discipline to stop and lay out the steps that will
help achieve the goal.*/
